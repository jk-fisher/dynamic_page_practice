A classic 1920s murder mystery.

It’s straight out of an Agatha Christie thriller: a meek-mannered country solicitor poisons his domineering wife, then sets about dosing a rival solicitor over a tea with a scone laced with arsenic. The man subsequently falls ill with symptoms similar to the dead wife. The solicitor is found with packets of arsenic in his pockets and more in his desk – bought, he claimed, from a local chemist to poison the dandelions in his lawn. Such is the true tale of Major Herbert Rowse Armstrong, tried for the murder of his wife and executed in 1922 - the only solicitor ever to be hanged in Britain.

The Armstrong case intrigued writers in the golden age of detective novels - Dorothy Sayers incorporated elements of the Armstrong case in two of her books and Georgette Heyer is said to have based a character on the diminutive solicitor. The case - a classic 1920s murder mystery set in 'Midsomer Murders' territory – remains contentious, though it has not been written about in depth for many years and, as the centenary of the trial occurs, it deserves re-examination. A whodunit with a twist – that it really happened.
